# Student Performance Tracker

This project is a Python-based application that allows teachers to manage and track student grades using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The system calculates averages, checks if students are passing, and provides detailed performance feedback.

## Features

- **Add Students**: Input student names and their scores for multiple subjects.
- **Performance Analysis**:
  - Calculate individual student averages and determine pass/fail status.
  - Compute the overall class average.
- **Detailed Reports**:
  - Display performance reports for all students.
  - Show class averages and overall statistics.
- **Error Handling**:
  - Robust handling of invalid or incomplete inputs.

## How It Works

### 1. Add Students:
- Input the student's name and their scores for predefined subjects.

### 2. Performance Calculation:
- Calculate each student's average score.
- Check if a student passes all subjects (passing threshold: **40**).

### 3. Class Analysis:
- Compute the class average based on all student averages.

### 4. Report Generation:
- Display a detailed performance report for each student.
- Show class averages and overall statistics.
